Database Systems,CSC,554,Advanced Database Management,In this class we will discuss concepts technologies guiding principles processes and best practices in managing database environment to meet high availability scalability and compliance needs. Organizations with business critical applications must reduce their risk of downtime manage database environment efficiently and ensure data meets compliance requirements effectively. IT now has additional responsibilities to secure and manage information in alignment with legal records management and regulations. This class explores methods and techniques to achieve the availability needs and also focuses on how to protect the database against disasters by maintaining multiple copies of the databases in separate locations synchronized in real-time. Students learn to design and manage key business resumption functions including disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans. Data governance challenges will be discussed along with solutions including data life cycle management preservation retention and disposition.,CSC453-CSC454,"145,36,35,65,150,17,16,137,9,52,117,53,57,119,0,121,64,56,72,73,138,135,134,160,15,93,63,112,54,113,62,157,97,4,28,7,76,96,107,55,133,77,58,128,142,161,284,108,111,304,270,268,271,299,305,275,267,274,277,293,276,298,265,290,261,294,291,297,301,306,273,260,259,280,296,288,292,283,281,136,122,300,295,264,5,29,272,262,302,258,287,278,266,116,149,279,303,282,61,102,285,14,263,59,159,90,286,147,289,86,78,269,88,94,66,234,67,124,199,228,211,233,249,218,22,255,229,232,203,248,222,208,250,226,230,245,219,241,253,256,227,239,215,216,223,201,254,247,243,257,238,200,236,206,109,242,244,221,251,220,237,209,213,207,240,197,217,198,252,214,205,224,87,246,212,132,71,225,519,336,126,204,51,33,10,523,531,231,60,127,235,536,532,529,521,528,533,516,525,325,210,526,343,514,351,518,308,515,332,512,539,329,319,322,334,356,317,354,98,535,328,362,342,359,346,315,327,202,520,341,337,333,129,103,350,311,330,347,345,348,513,534,353,326,349,364,358,151,75,363,538,352,335,310,360,314,357,318,324,340,361,316,323,527,331,537,95,524,355,338,309,307,118,517,20,8,44,31,321,339,313,530,522,181,320,169,11,312,139,196,110,24,176,184,175,167,156,92,89,195,182,194,164,191,193,186,189,190,82,187,188,168,170,192,178,174,148,104,130,163,179,185,165,489,146,504,70,131,158,99,171,490,495,485,505,469,477,344,173,483,476,478,481,464,500,497,510,462,499,503,507,511,493,508,482,479,492,502,506,468,166,154,85,473,470,471,498,463,488,491,475,180,32,50,509,484,480,474,486,501,465,12,115,496,487,467,461,494,183,177,155,91,472,79,466,172,13,34,25,40,74,120,114,125,68,27,43,2,101,460,386,437,381,385,430,434,422,453,388,433,380,378,387,392,397,421,389,435,369,384,376,372,450,401,414,415,459,451,366,417,427,432,447,410,419,406,405,383,413,408,407,367,418,455,441,390,440,443,398,431,439,442,396,373,426,444,454,400,403,374,412,377,452,382,449,375,428,438,391,105,416,446,457,420,425,23,6,30,365,458,84,436,393,80,152,368,371,394,395,424,409,411,379,402,456,162,429,399,448,81,153,370,404,100,141,47,41,445,423,26,69,3,1,83,123,144,106,19,45,21,39,38,18,46,140,42,143,48,49,37"

Software Engineering,SE,546,Software Architecture and Design for Desktop Applications,This course will introduce students to architecture design and implementation issues for developing GUI-based desktop application. The goal is to understand the engineering aspect of user interface development -- that is the basic software architectures and designs that govern the development of graphical user applications including patterns like the Model-View-Controller and its derivatives event-driven design as well as addressing concurrency performance caching and software packaging and distribution issues. The course will also provide an in depth exposure to the toolkits available in Java.

Game and Real-Time Systems,GPH,580,Hardware Shading Techniques,This class explores the current trends in programmable computer graphics hardware. Modern graphics processing units (GPU's) are becoming increasingly powerful and fully programmable parallel processing units. They make extremely sophisticated effects in computer graphics such as shadows displacement maps skinning motion blur reflections and refractions possible in real-time scenes. In addition these increasingly general programmable units are being used for far more general computing problems from traditional searching and sorting algorithms to computational problems in physics such as the diffusion equation and fluid flow. In this course we will explore the applications of hardware shading to computer graphics including advanced lighting shading and surface effects. As time allows we will explore other applications such as physics and computer science.,GPH469-GAM470,"0,52,61,65,76,84,22,87,93,117,128,17,36,147,145,160,150,35,143,48,336,360,325,342,344,343,355,308,332,321,338,312,309,335,329,319,322,334,316,339,356,354,307,313,328,362,359,346,327,337,341,333,311,350,330,347,345,348,349,364,353,358,326,363,320,352,310,314,357,318,324,361,340,323,96,248,246,234,235,197,199,223,228,211,212,214,233,249,218,255,229,205,225,232,224,203,222,208,137,41,226,245,230,253,219,241,256,227,239,215,216,204,198,201,254,252,238,247,243,257,200,236,206,210,242,231,244,221,220,251,237,209,213,207,240,351,315,163,77,393,410,380,397,386,381,370,385,399,388,378,387,368,411,392,371,394,379,389,395,365,369,384,404,376,402,414,401,415,366,391,417,250,416,419,405,406,408,383,413,407,367,418,390,398,396,373,412,403,400,374,377,382,161,375,317,331,217,465,489,64,141,47,504,466,480,474,461,490,492,496,487,486,485,467,501,505,469,477,475,476,494,478,481,472,464,500,497,509,510,484,462,507,511,499,503,493,508,482,502,506,468,40,25,473,470,463,498,488,471,491,372,54,202,495,129,103,88,479,45,409,89,279,304,287,270,268,271,524,423,520,299,513,305,275,6,30,523,531,263,267,274,277,527,293,276,298,286,532,529,521,537,265,290,528,285,261,294,291,533,297,273,301,306,483,303,535,517,516,260,282,280,259,525,269,296,522,292,288,283,281,534,300,526,295,289,264,514,538,518,431,272,262,258,302,512,539,436,60,460,437,430,434,422,424,453,429,433,101,421,456,435,450,459,451,447,432,427,455,441,458,440,443,442,439,426,454,444,452,449,438,428,86,446,457,420,154,85,515,530,74,42,142,278,80,152,148,78,519,284,425,16,536,66,94,266,39,21,10,33,51,448,113,151,75,445,20,69,26,127,19,79,9,100,155,91,120,97,157,102,162,1,90,159,50,32,133,8,31,44,114,55,125,68,38,18,49,70,131,126,136,130,104,12,144,106,139,95,146,58,92,156,23,24,27,2,43,62,63,5,29,153,81,11,158,99,173,140,46,169,166,109,105,171,196,121,176,184,175,195,182,194,172,164,191,189,186,193,190,180,187,183,188,168,177,192,174,178,185,179,165,167,123,83,124,67,82,170,14,115,132,71,134,138,135,72,73,107,108,111,56,34,13,116,149,112,3,181,7,57,4,28,15,59,110,53,118,98,119,122,37"
Game and Real-Time Systems,SE,456,Architecture of Real-Time Systems,This course discusses the principles styles and patterns of real-time software architecture. Trade-offs and ramifications of software architecture with respect to performance maintainability and reusability will be explored. The course will also investigate the design and implementation of real-time behavior and constraints for Common Design Patterns such as Observer Visitor and Strategy. Finally the course will demonstrate how creation of real-time Data Driven environment allows the run-time object data to control the behavior and flow of an application. These topics will be discussed in the context of best practices in software engineering such as iterative development testing and continuous integration.,CSC403,"117,150,160,9,12,54,55,36,52,65,35,145,93,17,133,119,0,61,76,56,15,107,57,47,141,128,115,142,137,139,147,161,148,63,8,31,44,45,29,5,10,51,33,1,60,110,122,50,32,59,118,121,143,48,20,162,41,94,66,77,120,112,2,27,43,58,19,113,87,30,6,16,7,11,124,67,157,97,34,13,22,159,90,146,284,25,40,21,39,3,304,108,270,271,299,305,275,78,263,274,277,293,276,265,290,261,294,297,306,301,273,260,282,278,269,70,71,132,131,296,288,292,283,281,300,295,264,279,163,272,262,23,28,4,64,302,258,303,125,68,80,152,437,430,99,158,267,289,434,422,424,453,298,433,429,285,291,421,151,75,435,259,280,460,450,459,451,432,455,441,440,136,436,442,426,444,454,452,449,428,438,448,127,446,420,457,425,266,287,268,458,84,53,49,286,431,169,427,447,166,443,445,439,196,176,423,184,175,456,172,164,191,74,186,190,193,189,187,42,188,168,69,26,174,178,192,185,179,165,181,14,114,180,62,96,177,24,171,116,149,183,126,105,167,182,194,195,173,82,140,46,170,410,86,380,381,385,387,386,392,371,379,369,384,391,417,405,383,408,419,413,407,367,418,390,393,404,398,396,373,412,403,374,400,377,382,416,375,406,103,129,388,378,411,372,389,365,104,130,376,399,402,401,414,415,366,409,370,102,397,368,485,467,109,505,395,477,476,479,478,472,464,500,497,394,484,480,462,499,511,503,507,493,508,482,461,502,506,468,496,473,470,509,510,336,463,488,498,471,491,523,490,494,492,465,489,495,536,529,486,528,474,501,517,515,469,525,475,483,522,481,534,526,514,530,518,38,18,355,512,539,531,538,321,527,504,466,329,521,537,524,322,533,487,313,516,362,328,327,311,350,330,347,532,345,348,331,520,360,326,358,353,364,349,363,320,352,513,310,314,357,318,324,356,332,361,340,519,338,323,309,335,535,343,319,153,81,307,359,315,346,337,341,333,342,334,354,312,344,79,317,89,308,316,351,325,339,98,91,155,156,92,85,154,249,222,245,256,227,215,216,204,228,211,201,198,254,238,243,257,247,200,236,239,206,210,242,135,134,73,138,72,233,244,217,221,251,220,235,218,237,209,213,252,255,240,207,229,205,232,224,203,248,208,250,226,230,241,219,253,197,212,214,199,231,223,202,234,225,101,246,111,100,95,144,106,88,83,123,37"
